###  Display customerâ€™s available products
> As a **customer**, I want to select the **products** that are available to me, based on the **location** of my home.

### Build & Run
`//TODO`

### Future Improvements
##### Catalogue Service
- Contract testing to ensure that the service complies with the agreed-upon schema
- Setup Docker to run this and any future services
- GraphQL would be nice, probably overkill though

##### Product Selection Client
- Behavioural tests using CasperJS would automate testing of user journeys
- Better error handling if request to Catalogue Service fails
- Dynamically generate product lists based off category, rather than having hard-coded News and Sports lists
